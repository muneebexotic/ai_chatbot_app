# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive multi-language support to the Flutter chatbot app, allowing users to interact with the application in their preferred language. The system will support 7 languages: English, Urdu, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, French, and Arabic. Users can select their preferred language from the settings screen, and the entire application interface will be localized accordingly. The feature includes proper text direction support for right-to-left languages (Arabic and Urdu) and ensures all user-facing text is translatable.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select my preferred language from the settings screen, so that I can use the app in a language I'm comfortable with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the settings screen THEN the system SHALL display a language selection option
2. WHEN the user taps on the language selection option THEN the system SHALL show a list of 7 supported languages (English, Urdu, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, French, Arabic)
3. WHEN the user selects a language THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the language change to the entire application
4. WHEN the user selects a language THEN the system SHALL persist the language preference for future app sessions
5. IF the user has not previously selected a language THEN the system SHALL default to the device's system language if supported, otherwise default to English

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all text in the application to be displayed in my selected language, so that I can fully understand and navigate the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a language is selected THEN the system SHALL translate all static text elements including buttons, labels, titles, and menu items
2. WHEN a language is selected THEN the system SHALL translate all error messages and validation text
3. WHEN a language is selected THEN the system SHALL translate all placeholder text and hints
4. WHEN a language is selected THEN the system SHALL translate all dialog boxes and confirmation messages
5. WHEN a language is selected THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent terminology throughout the application
6. WHEN displaying dates and numbers THEN the system SHALL format them according to the selected language's locale conventions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user who speaks a right-to-left language, I want the app layout to properly support RTL text direction, so that the interface feels natural and readable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Arabic or Urdu is selected THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to right-to-left text direction
2. WHEN RTL is active THEN the system SHALL mirror the layout of navigation elements, buttons, and icons appropriately
3. WHEN RTL is active THEN the system SHALL align text content to the right side
4. WHEN RTL is active THEN the system SHALL reverse the order of UI elements where culturally appropriate
5. WHEN switching between LTR and RTL languages THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition the layout without visual glitches

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my chat conversations to be displayed in my selected language interface, so that I can navigate and understand the chat functionality clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the chat screen THEN the system SHALL display all UI elements (send button, input placeholder, menu options) in the selected language
2. WHEN viewing chat history THEN the system SHALL display timestamps and system messages in the selected language
3. WHEN accessing chat settings or options THEN the system SHALL display all menu items and labels in the selected language
4. WHEN displaying error messages related to chat functionality THEN the system SHALL show them in the selected language
5. IF the selected language is RTL THEN the system SHALL properly align chat bubbles and interface elements for RTL reading

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the localization system to be maintainable and extensible, so that new languages can be easily added in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing localization THEN the system SHALL use Flutter's built-in internationalization framework
2. WHEN adding new text THEN the system SHALL require all strings to be externalized to translation files
3. WHEN adding a new language THEN the system SHALL only require adding a new translation file without code changes
4. WHEN building the app THEN the system SHALL generate type-safe access to all localized strings
5. WHEN a translation is missing THEN the system SHALL fall back to English and log the missing translation for debugging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the language change to take effect immediately without restarting the app, so that I can quickly switch between languages if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a new language THEN the system SHALL update all visible text immediately without requiring an app restart
2. WHEN the language changes THEN the system SHALL update the text direction if switching between LTR and RTL languages
3. WHEN the language changes THEN the system SHALL maintain the user's current screen and navigation state
4. WHEN the language changes THEN the system SHALL update any cached or stored UI text elements
5. WHEN the language changes THEN the system SHALL notify all relevant providers and widgets to rebuild with new translations
